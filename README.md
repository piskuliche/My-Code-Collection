# Python-Code-Collection

This is a repository of many of my production level codes, primarily written in python but with some fortran mixed in.

All of these codes have been written by me, Zeke Piskulich, at the University of Kansas during my time as a graduate student.

Feel free to use any pieces of these codes for your own works, but please point people here as well!

## Code Structure

There are three main places where codes are stored:

-Simulation\_Analysis: Codes that are primarily focused on analyzing simulations (examples are radial distribution function, etc)
-Simulation\_Codes: Codes that are focused on running simulations.
-Util: Codes that assist and provide general QOL things.

## Installation Instructions

Building the codes are very simple, just open make.sh and modify the homepath variable to your home directory. Then type:

```
bash make.sh
```
